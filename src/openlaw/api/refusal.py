"""What every non-2xx `/ask` response carries, in common.

**Every terminal response a caller can receive -- not only a quota refusal --
must run crisis detection and carry the escalation footer.** Task 4's review
(H1, M4) found this applied to the quota refusal alone: the rate-limit 429
and the 500 handler were both bare dead ends, and a woman typing "my husband
beats me" into a rate-limited or momentarily-broken deployment got nothing
but "try again". `crisis_extras` below is the one function every refusal
path calls, so the property holds everywhere by construction rather than by
each call site remembering to reimplement it.

**Crisis detection on a refusal path still cannot afford the paid,
CLASSIFIER-role model call.** The review's M3 asked for "the same crisis
detection the main path uses" (that full two-layer check); this module
does NOT do that literally, and the reason is a cost/abuse argument, not an
oversight -- flagged explicitly in the Task 4 follow-up report. A refusal
happens precisely when a caller has exhausted or exceeded their allowance;
calling a paid model on every subsequent request from that same caller would
let them spend money indefinitely simply by continuing to POST after being
refused, with no quota gate in front of it (the gate is what just refused
them). What IS adopted from M3 is the actual gap it identified: the free
regex layer (`openlaw.answers.escalation.detect_crisis`) cannot match most
non-Latin script. Plan 6 Task 10 (ruling 2) narrowed that for Devanagari
with a deliberately narrow, precision-tuned pattern set, and narrowing is
all it did: a Hindi phrasing outside those patterns, and every other Indic
script entirely, still reaches this module with the regex silent. The hedge
below therefore stays exactly as it is. `_looks_non_latin` closes the gap
cheaply, with no model call: when the regex is silent AND the question
contains non-Latin-script characters (a proxy for "this matcher is known not
to fire here"), the caller still gets `GENERIC_SAFETY_NOTE` -- the full set
of helplines, un-triaged by category -- rather than silence.

**The upload surface's refusals go out through the same helper (Plan 6 Task
15).** `POST /documents` can fail five new ways -- too large, unsupported
type, unreadable, too many documents, uploads disabled -- and `DELETE
/documents/{id}` and `/ask` can both 404 on an id the caller does not own.
Every one of those is a terminal response for somebody who may be in danger,
so every one is raised by `raise_refusal` below, which assembles
`crisis_extras` and `refusal_detail` into one body shape shared with the 500
and 422 handlers in `app.py`. There is deliberately no path on that surface
that returns a bare status code.

**Refusal `detail` strings are static and bilingual, not translated.**
`refusal_detail` selects from a fixed, pre-written English/Hindi pair rather
than calling the translation pipeline: an error path must not depend on the
very system that may have just failed (a model outage is exactly when a 500
fires). Hindi and English are the two languages Plan 4's review cleared for
launch; other `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` fall back to English here until their
own static pairs are written -- a deliberate, narrower promise than the
answer pipeline's full language coverage, and documented as such rather than
silently mistranslating.
